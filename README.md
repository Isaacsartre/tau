## Description
 Tau is a nebelung cat interbred from two 4 and 3 year old male and female blue-eyed nebelungs respectively. He has been interested in Piano music ever since I brought him with me to my acoustics room. I noticed his anxiousness to want to get directly involved when he would jump on the keys and scratch me everytime I tried to get him off, he would only get off when he finished playing his pieces, which were nothing more than melodic noise at first but after watching me play I noticed his subsequent pieces resembling the pieces I usually played.
