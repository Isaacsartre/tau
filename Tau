    <h1>My very Feisty Nebelung</h1>
    <p>I got my nebelung from an orphanage in Ohio. I was out biking when I came across this homeless cat orphanage near Walmart. I always wanted to have a cat, kind of got the whole charm and enigma without the drama, unlike my girlfriend. So I waltzed in and hadn't even fully opened the swing wing door when this gray haired blue-eyed rebel ran up to me, wasn't Clint Eastwood by the way<img src="images/clint.jpg" alt="A picture of a rather angry Clint">. Sorry man, I'm just joking.</p>
    <p>I knew almost immediately I was going back home with this ball of fur, we blended almost immediately. You can learn more about Nebelung cats <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebelung">here</a>. To be continued.</p>
